For this race, I experimented with a slightly longer warm up that included very quick strides and some slower strides for a longer duration.</p>\n<p>Kevin gave me a race strategy, but after a 5:51 first mile which felt surprisingly easy, I decided to maintain that pace instead of going a few seconds slower. My 5K split goal was 18:30 but I managed an 18:16 split. Everything was going well and I expected a slow 4th mile, but I was not expecting to slightly cramp up and not be able to breathe. After a few deep breaths I was back at it, running alongside another runner who kept me right on pace. Actually, I did not know how fast I was going for the last 2.2 miles but I knew I had to keep on attacking. Right around 5.70 miles into the race I began my kick, knowing there would only be about half a mile left. About 200m to go and I see Chaz running in the opposite direction cheering me on and I start my final kick. Final time of 36:34 and tied for third with Nate for Queens Distance.</p>\n<h3>Youth Race</h3>\n<p>Quickly after picking up my baggage, I run down to 59th and 5th Ave. to pick up my brother for his youth race. I was a bit worried about him coming to Central Park all by himself but it turned out that my sister accompanied him. It was very sweet of her, especially because she worked a night shift at her job. It’s around 9:30am, we get some coffee and head to the start. After a quick pep talk, he was off running a 12:50 1.7 mile race. It’s his first of a couple of races this year and I’m really excited to see how he does at the Queens 10K!</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"6\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\"><div style=\"padding:8px;\"> <div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\"> <div style=\" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"></div></div> <p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BDtEynUHUvT/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_blank\">Great time this morning at the Scotland Run 10K!
