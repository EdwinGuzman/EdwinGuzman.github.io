I poured countless of cups of water over my head trying to cool down as the sun melted all the runners around me. As I turn a corner I look into the distance and see a small Hollywood sign, one of the many tantalizing moments during the 2016 Los Angeles Marathon.

But how exactly did I get there?! It's the last week of December in 2015 and I'm in a disappointing situation--a long story for another time--and I decide that I must make the most of my current situation. I've always wanted to visit California, one of my best friends, Ted, lives there, and I get the chance to run the Los Angeles Marathon the day after attending the US Olympic Team Trials. More than enough reasons to go to San Francisco!

My friend lives in the Bay Area and I was fortunate enough to explore the area for a few days. I ran over the Golden Gate Bridge, an incredible experience I dreamt of doing for years, did hill repeats on Lombard Street, and went museum hopping. Ted then drove us down to LA for the next part of the adventure.

The U.S. Olympic Team Trials for the marathon was inspiring to watch. The runners competing for a spot in the U.S. Olympic team for Rio 2016 are professional runners and runners who work full-time jobs and compete on the side. I read up on many of the part-time runners who earned a spot at the trial. Many knew that they would not win but were honored by being part of this experience. Fighting for a spot to compete with the best is what drives me forward.
