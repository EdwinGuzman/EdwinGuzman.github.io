refactoring and reorganizing code
not just for cleanliness but for code undesrtanding
as i understood the codebase and logic better, refactoring made a lot more sense
"reorganize to refelct your undersating of it"
“never reorganizing [the code] to reflect your understanding.” 
as i better understood the logic and requirements, it was eaiser to move ror code into node and virutalyl remove al ot of it
building on partial understanding and then cleaning it once understanding improves

learning from mistakes
- better communications
- who is in charge of what and why don't ppl comment on jira tickets?
- _app getInitialProps calling IP API multiple times and losing free requests per month
- csrf token, build_id, and production is different than qa
- why didn't we user test?

###
lack of comm at work
- cloud library? testing
- no one answers jira tickets
- librarians not expecting things
  - library name in dropdown
- no one told me designs or copy was updated until the last moment
- 90 vs 30 day temp period for card
- ils and ask teams not talking to each other about list of library names
  - branch vs library
- not all knowing the logic and how to get ptypes
